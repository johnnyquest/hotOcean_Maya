hotOcean_Maya
=============

A Maya version of Drew Whitehouse's Houdini Ocean Toolkit (HOT).

Most of the Maya-related code was written by Nico Rehberg.

Minor modifications and various code cleanups and cosmetics
by Imre Tuske (sorted out build problems on linux;
cross-platform build [waf] script).

Thanks to Szabolcs Horvatth and John Patrick for tips and
hints on colorsets-in-deformers hackery.

The Houdini Ocean Toolkit is copyrighted by Drew Whitehouse

The fftw libary comes from http://www.fftw.org/

HOW TO BUILD
============

The provided build script is written for waf (you'll need python).

In your command line, type:

	./waf distclean configure build


or, if you don't have permissions right or you're on windows, type:

	python waf distclean configure build


You'll find the build .mll/.so in the root folder.

This package contains a mental ray shader and a Maya deformer that use
the Houdini Ocean Toolkit to generate Tessendorf waves in Maya.

See the Tessendorf notes for a deeper understanding of the parameters.

I merely did the "wrapping" into a shader/deformer. All the magic comes from
Drew Whitehouses code.
